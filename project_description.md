***GUI Server Improvement***

***Due Dates: Friday April 29th @11:59pm***

Since this is the end of the semester, there will be no late turn in or
extensions given on this project.

***Description:***
In this project, you will be improving the GUI server and client sample application that
we saw a few weeks back.



***Implementation Details:***

You will make the following changes to the GUI server and client Maven project posted
on BB:

    [x] Each client will display a current list of other clients on the server

    [x] This list must update for each client as others join and drop from the server

    [x] Each client will have the ability to text an individual client, group or clients or all of the
    clients at the same time

    [x] Your server code must be thread safe. Currently it is not. (You will use synchronization to accomplish this)


***Extra Credit:***
For 10 points extra credit, use FXML to create the client and server graphical interface.
This would replace the way it is currently done in the sample app.

***Electronic Submission:***
You must include a PDF file called Collaboration.pdf if you worked in a team of two. In
that document, put both of your names and netIds as well as a description of who
worked on what in the project. Zip the Maven project (and PDF if you worked in a group)
and name it with your netid + Project5: for example, I would have a submission called
mhalle5Project5.zip, and submit it to the link on Blackboard course website.
